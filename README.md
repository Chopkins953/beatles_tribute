# beatles_tribute

In this project I utilized Kotlin to build an Android application that used a pair of recycler views to populate the entire Beatles album history from a file to the RecyclerView and each song from the album would be populated when an album was clicked. If a song was clicked the application would query the Youtube API with the search arguments being the title of the song and “Beatles” and would open a WebView with the best matching result in the application.

Note: The video functionality no longer works because of the youtube API key no longer being valid. You can edit the hard-coded string with another key and it should work fine.
